# Market Entry Notes
When assessing entry into a new country:
- Market size and growth (e.g., GDP, category growth)
- Competitive intensity and substitutes
- Regulation and barriers to entry
- Distribution and channel access
- Local cost structure and supply availability
- Risks: FX, political, operational

A common output is a composite **market attractiveness score** driven by these factors.
