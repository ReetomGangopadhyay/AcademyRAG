# Value Chain Playbook
## Core Idea
A value chain decomposes firm activities (inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing & sales, service) to identify **cost drivers** and **differentiators**.

## Common Cost Drivers
- Scale of operations
- Learning and experience effects
- Capacity utilization
- Linkage efficiencies across activities
- Technology and process design
- Input costs and supplier relationships

## Typical Analyses
- Cost curve benchmarking
- Activity-based costing
- Sensitivity analysis on utilization and input prices
